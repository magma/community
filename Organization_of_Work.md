# Organization of work in Magma development

## Roles

The following is a high-level summary of the Magma project's roles as defined in [Magma's Technical Charter](https://github.com/magma/tsc/blob/main/CHARTER.md).

### Contributors

Anyone can become a Contributor by submitting a pull request to the project
and having that change accepted through the project’s review process. A
Contributor is someone who has had code merged within the last 12 months.
Contributors have access to propose and review code but not merge the code
into repos of the project.

### Committers

A Committer has the ability to merge code into the project. Committers are
active Contributors and participants in the project. In order to become a
Committer, you must be nominated and approved by the established Committers
through a simple majority vote.  Within the project, sub-components may decide to have additional requirements
for the review of code in their repos.

### Technical Steering Committee (TSC)

The TSC consists of 5 members nominated and elected by the project's Committers.
The Technical Steering Committee (the “TSC”) will be responsible for all technical
oversight of the open source Project.

As of March 11, 2021 the TSC members are:

- Scott Moeller (@electronjoe)
- Raphael Defosseux (@rdefosse)
- Pravin Shelar (@pshelar)
- Hunter Gatewood (@hcgatewood)
- Marie Bremner (@themarwhal)
