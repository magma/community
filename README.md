# Magma

Magma is an open-source software platform that gives network operators an open, flexible and extendable mobile core network solution. Magma enables better connectivity by:

* Allowing operators to offer cellular service without vendor lock-in with a modern, open source core network
* Enabling operators to manage their networks more efficiently with more automation, less downtime, better predictability, and more agility to add new services and applications
* Enabling federation between existing MNOs and new infrastructure providers for expanding rural infrastructure
* Allowing operators who are constrained with licensed spectrum to add capacity and reach by using Wi-Fi and CBRS
