# Magma governance

Magma is committed to implementing the
[Four Opens](https://www.openstack.org/four-opens/): Open source, Open
development, Open design and Open community. An open governance model, where
technical decisions are made by technical contributors and a representative
body accessible to every contributor, is a critical part in establishing a
truly open community.

Magma's open technical governance, as detailed in its [Technical Charter](https://github.com/magma/tsc/blob/main/CHARTER.md), is built around the
the following model:

## Contributers

Anyone may become a contributer to the Magma project.  A contributer is someone who contributes code to the prject github repository, initiates or comments on github issues or contributes to the project in any other way.  Magma's contributers are its community.

## Committers

Committers are contributers who have earned the right to make modifications to the Magma github repository, as set forth in the [CONTRIBUTING file](https://github.com/magma/community/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).  Committers are able to merge code or otherwise modify the Magma github repository.  Committers may be added to or removed from the project by a majority vote of existing committers, with no single committer objecting.

Issues may be raised to the Committers on the "#goverance-committers-ama" channel on the Magma Slack

## The Technical Steering Committee

The Committers of the project will elect 5 of their members to serve as a Technical Steering Committee (TSC) for the project.  The TSC will be responsible for all technical oversight of the project.

As of March 11, 2021, the project TSC members are:
- Hunter Gatewood (hcgatewood)
- Marie Bremner (@themarwhal)
- Raphael Defosseux (@rdefosse)
- Scott Moeller (@electronjoe)
- Pravin Shelar (@pshelar)

Issues may be raised to the TSC on the "#goverance-tsc-ama" channel on the Magma Slack
